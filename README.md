# arduino_tremolo
h1 Easy tremolo effect.
Scheme based on photoresist and LED, where arduino is variable type wave oscillator.
In this project I used arduino pro mini with [mozzi library](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/).
Effect has three parameter
1. Frequency.
2. Rate.
3. Waveform - /| /\ Â¯|_ |\ (sawtooth, triangle, square, revers sawtooth)
Also, you can plug pedal/button for tap tempo (pin3) and plug sync signal (pin2). Second in priority.
